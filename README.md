- Neutral

Also displays:
- Polarity (scale: -1 to +1)
- Subjectivity (scale: 0 to 1)

### 📌 How to Run:
```bash
cd task2_slab2
pip install flask textblob
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

## ✅ Task 3: Simulated Gemini AI Integration (Slab 2 - Task 3)

This simulates integration with **Google Gemini AI**, maintaining conversation history and generating simple responses.

> Note: For simplicity, this version does not call the real API. You can expand it with actual API keys and `google-generativeai` package.

### 📌 How to Run:
```bash
cd task3_slab2
python gemini.py
```

Type messages to simulate a conversation. Type `exit` or `quit` to end.
